# 0x01. Python - Async

## Overview
This repository contains projects and exercises to practice asynchronous programming in Python. The focus is on understanding async I/O, event loops, and working with `asyncio`, a core Python library designed for asynchronous programming.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the concept of concurrency and asynchronous programming.
- Understand the differences between synchronous and asynchronous execution.
- Use `async` and `await` to define asynchronous functions in Python.
- Manage tasks with the `asyncio` module and work with event loops.
- Handle multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently using Python.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following files:

- **0-asyncio_basic.py**: Example of basic asynchronous function using `async` and `await`.
- **1-wait_n.py**: Implementation of a function that executes multiple coroutines concurrently and returns their results.
- **2-measure_runtime.py**: Measure the execution time of asynchronous tasks.
- **3-tasks.py**: Demonstration of how to use tasks in `asyncio`.
- **4-tasks_advanced.py**: Advanced use of `asyncio` tasks to run concurrent operations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with `asyncio` is helpful but not required

## Installation

To run the projects in this repository, make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

```bash
python3 --version
